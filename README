The program was developed with Python 3.8.10. It uses f-strings, so at least version 3.6 is required.

Running the program:
python3 weatherbot.py

Installing the imports, if necessary:
pip install -r requirements.txt

An internet connection is required and the OpenWeather service must be functional.
