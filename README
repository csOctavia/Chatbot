“The Weatherbot” is a console-based program that answers weather-related questions and identifies greetings and requests for small talk by performing information retrieval and question matching. 
To read a more detailed presentation of this project, check the 'Chatbot Report' pdf file attached.

The program was developed with Python 3.8.10. It uses f-strings, so at least version 3.6 is required.

Running the program:
python3 weatherbot.py

Installing the imports, if necessary:
pip install -r requirements.txt

An internet connection is required and the OpenWeather service must be functional.
